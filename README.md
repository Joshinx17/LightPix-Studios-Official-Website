# LightPix-show-rating
This is the official website for the LightPix Studios. It presents our creative writing works, novelization, and illustrations by developing a website where you now can get access to our personal creative space.

This website also provides a platform for rating, creating lists and interacting with audience about shows and TV series, exclusively.
When it comes to movies we have a lot of platforms like IMDB and Letterboxd to create lists and add ratings and reviews to those movies but in case of TV-series and shows, we don't have a dedicated platform to do so. Hence LightPix show rating is exactly built for that purpose.
